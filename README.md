# University assignment to build a game over three months using Java and JavaFX following the principle of Agile Software development in a team of 4.

As a software developer, I created "Mind-Snatcher," an interactive adventure game built in Java using JavaFX. This game features a deeply integrated story with a Player vs. Player (PVP) fighting system, delivering an immersive and competitive experience for players.

One of the primary goals of "Mind-Snatcher" is to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. To achieve this, we incorporated several disability-friendly features. All narration in the game is accompanied by audio cues, providing essential information for players with visual impairments. Additionally, the game offers multiple viewing modes, including Color-blind mode, Black and White mode, and Regular mode, ensuring that players with various visual challenges can enjoy the game comfortably.

"Mind-Snatcher" not only offers engaging gameplay and a rich storyline but also prioritizes inclusivity, making it a standout example of accessible game design.
