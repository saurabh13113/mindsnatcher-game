University assignment to build a game over three months using Java and JavaFX following the principle of Agile Software development in a team of 4.

As a software developer, I created "Mind-Snatcher," an interactive adventure game developed in Java using JavaFX. This game combines a richly integrated story with a Player vs. Player (PVP) fighting system, delivering an immersive and competitive experience for players. In "Mind-Snatcher," players navigate through a compelling narrative while engaging in strategic battles against each other, blending storytelling and gameplay seamlessly.

One of the primary goals of "Mind-Snatcher" is to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. To achieve this, we incorporated several disability-friendly features. All narration in the game is accompanied by audio cues, providing essential information and guidance for players with visual impairments. This ensures that everyone can follow the storyline and navigate the game effectively.

Additionally, the game offers multiple viewing modes to accommodate different visual needs. These modes include Color-blind mode, Black and White mode, and Regular mode, allowing players to choose the visual setting that best suits their requirements. By offering these options, "Mind-Snatcher" ensures that players with various visual challenges can enjoy the game comfortably and without hindrance.
